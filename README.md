To run the synchronization Python program, use the following command in the command line:

```bash
python synchronize_two_folders.py path/to/the/source path/to/the/replica 10 path/to/the/log

This command takes four arguments:
- >The first one is the path to the source directory.
- >The second one is the path to the replica directory.
- >The third one is the number of seconds, specifying the interval at which the synchronization will be executed.
- >The last one is the path to the log file.

Here's an example of usage:

python synchronize_two_folders.py source replica 10 log.txt

In this example, the source, replica, and log file are assumed to be located in the same directory, 
and the synchronization frequency is set to 10 seconds.
